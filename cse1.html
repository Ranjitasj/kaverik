<p>Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, 
spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of
 New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls,
 which straddles the international border of the two countries. It is known as the Canadian Falls.
 The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States.
 Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island.
